<p>3.1 <b>Market Data Feeds.</b> The Company uses market data feeds received from third parties for quotes provided on our website and via the API. The Company cannot guarantee that those market data feeds will be identical to all other market data feeds. Furthermore, Third-Party Providers may make available to you market data feeds independent of market data feeds provided by the Company. Developer should be aware that from time to time there may be discrepancies between the market data presented by us and information provided by Third-Party Providers due to a variety of reasons, including the time to update and transmit such data to a website and latency caused by Third-Party Provider’s and/or your local environment (computer set up, connection speed, etc.). The Company is not responsible for the accuracy of Market Data transmitted via API or made available by Third-Party Providers. DEVELOPER ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT USE OF API AS A MEANS OF DISSEMINATING INFORMATION INCLUDING MARKET DATA OR ANY OTHER LICENSED OR COPYRIGHTED INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY AND YOU SHALL NOT ENGAGE IN SUCH PRACTICES. Developer is responsible for adhering to all terms and conditions of the market data agreements Developer accepted to open an account with E*TRADE and shall be liable for payment of any fees levied by exchanges, index vendors or other third parties for the market data Developer accesses via the Company’s facilities, whether such fees are billed directly to Developer or indirectly via the Company. Furthermore, the Company may, at any time and for any reason, without notice to you, terminate or otherwise restrict your access to any or all market data feeds provided by third parties through the Company.</p>
<p>3.2 <b>End User Data.</b> Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Company to provide any End User Account Log On information or End User Data to Developer. Developer understands that it is required to obtain the legally valid permission of the End User prior to accessing or storing any End User Data. Developer will comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing privacy, its privacy policy and the privacy policy of the Company in accessing or storing End User Data.</p>
<p>3.3 <b>Third-Party Provider Sites.</b> Material provided on API may have been produced by independent providers unaffiliated with us. To the extent that API or Third-Party Providers express opinions or make recommendations, you understand that such opinions and recommendations are expressed by Third-Party Provider and are not the opinions or recommendations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, independent contractors, agents, or employees. The existence of API and our consent to any connectivity between API and our technology, website or trading platform(s) does not constitute a recommendation by the Company to (i) invest in any security or utilize any investment strategy or (ii) does not constitute a representation, warranty or other guarantee by us as to the present or future value or suitability of any sale, trade or other transaction involving any particular security or any other investments. The existence of any and all information, tools and services provided by Third-Party Provider and/or by API shall not constitute our endorsement of Third-Party Provider and/or API.</p>
<p>3.4 <b>Access to Developer Personal Information by Developer Third-Party Providers.</b> Through Developer’s use of API, Developer may be providing Third-Party Providers with access to Developer’s Account(s) and Personal Information. By consenting to the use of API, Developer acknowledges that the security, policies, procedures and systems of Third-Party Providers may or may not be less stringent and secure than the Company’s policies, procedures and systems. Developer agrees that use of the API shall be subject to the policies, procedures of this Agreement. Developer acknowledges that the Company is not a party to any agreement by or between Developer and any Third-Party Provider. Developer acknowledges that the API may deliver Personal Information to the Company and the Company is authorized to receive and store that Personal Information consistent with the Company’s then in effect policies and procedures, and, furthermore, Developer agrees that API may request Personal Information stored by the Company, and consents to the Company’s disclosure of such Information and Account data to API.</p>

            <span><p><b>4.0 Obligations.</b></p>
<p>4.1 <b>Delivery of Access to API/ Developer Key:</b> Upon request of the Company, Developer will complete an API questionnaire which will assist in identifying Developer as either an Individual User Developer or a Vendor Use Developer. Upon completion of the API questionnaire, Developer will be provided a consumer key ("Consumer Key"), which is unique to the Application, by the Company as follows: (1) Developer must specify (via the API questionnaire process) whether an Individual Use Key or a Vendor Use Key is appropriate based upon their intended usage, (2) the Company shall deliver the Consumer Key to Developer by providing such Consumer Key to Developer in a message sent electronically through Developer’s account with the Company (the "Developer Account"), following Developer’s request (made electronically through the Developer Account) for the Consumer Key from the Company. Developer agrees to keep the Consumer Key confidential, and not to disclose it to, or share it with any Third-Party.</p>
<p>4.2 <b>Support Services.</b> The Company is not obligated to provide any support services, error corrections or technical support for the API or Application under this Agreement. All such services will be the responsibility of Developer. The Company, at its sole discretion, may make available to Developer system engineers to work with Developer’s system engineers in developing, testing and maintaining the Application, as mutually agreed by the parties.</p>
<p>4.3 <b>Development Responsibilities.</b> Developer hereby assumes all responsibility for and accepts all risks associated with: (1) the selection of the API to achieve Developer’s intended purposes; (2) the use of the API and Documentation pursuant to this Agreement; (3) any Derivative Works made by Developer, and (4) the results obtained from use of the API or any Derivative Works by Developer.</p>
<p>4.4 <b>Application Testing.</b> Developer shall test the Application for use with the E*TRADE System. The Company reserves the right to perform, but is not obligated to perform, acceptance testing of the Application, and Developer will provide reasonable cooperation with the Company should it desire to test the functions. Such testing by the Company shall not create any obligations on the part of the Company with respect to the Application, and Developer will not disclose in any manner to any Third-Party that the Company has performed testing of the Application, or the results of any such testing undertaken by the Company. The Developer will not make the functions of the Application available to End Users until the Application performs in accordance with the specifications and documentation for such Application and the functions have been tested and approved by Developer.</p>
<p>4.5 <b>Vendor Use Developer Obligations related to End Users. For the sake of clarity this Section 4.5 applies only to Vendor Use Developers.</b> Prior to making the functions of an Application available to an End User, the Vendor Use Developer will obtain an acknowledgment from End User in written form containing clear language that the Company is not responsible for the functionality of an Application or for results obtained from using an Application, that the Company is not endorsing the Developer Application and makes no representations or warranties to its performance, and that the Company is indemnified and held harmless from any liabilities that arise as a result of End User’s use of the Developer Application (the "End User Acknowledgment"). Developer will retain records evidencing End Users’ Acknowledgment during the term of this Agreement and for a period of not less than five years from the date of termination of this Agreement and will make such records available to the Company upon the Company’s request.</p>
<p>4.6 <b>Updates to the API and E*TRADE System.</b> The Company may release subsequent versions of the API and may make changes to the E*TRADE System and Developer will be responsible for obtaining and using the most recent version of the API. New versions may not be compatible with previous implementations. Updates will be subject to the same terms and conditions of this Agreement as relate to the API. The Company agrees to provide notice of proposed changes to the API or the E*TRADE System and technical information to the Developer as soon as commercially practicable. All such information shall be treated as Confidential Information of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an obligation on the part of the Company to make or refrain from making any changes to the E*TRADE System.</p>
<p>4.7 <b>Cost and Expenses.</b> Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, each party is responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under this Agreement. The Company is not responsible for costs and expenses incurred by Developer as a result of any change in the API or in the E*TRADE System. Neither party is obligated under this Agreement to share any revenues, pay any royalties, or otherwise pay commissions to the other party.</p>

It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for Recipient to make any disclosure of Confidential Information which is required by law, or pursuant to court order or subpoena. In such event, Recipient will (a) disclose only such Confidential Information which is required to be disclosed, (b) give Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such required disclosure to allow Disclosing Party to contest such disclosure if it so chooses, and (c) cooperate with Disclosing Party’s efforts to protect such information.</p>
<p>6.3 <b>Unauthorized Use.</b> Developer shall prevent, prosecute, and enjoin any unauthorized copying, distribution, reverse engineering, and reverse compiling of the API, through appropriate restrictive contracts entered into by its employees, and any consultants having access thereto through Developer, and shall pursue appropriate actions to enforce such protection provisions.
