As indicated herein, defined terms may also have the meanings described in the Self-Directed Account Agreement, and the terms and conditions of the Self-Directed Account Agreement shall apply to and have the same force and effect with respect to the Account and Client’s transactions hereunder as it does to Client’s Self-Directed Account and to the transactions thereunder; provided that, to the extent that the terms and conditions of the Self-Directed Account Agreement are made applicable hereto, references therein to “Morgan Stanley,” “Self-Directed Account,” and “Self-Directed Account Agreement” shall be construed to include E*TRADE Futures, the Account and this Futures Agreement, respectively. References to specific provisions of any statute, rule, or regulation shall be construed to include any revision or amendment thereto promulgated subsequent to the date hereof. In the event of an inconsistency or discrepancy between this Futures Agreement and any other agreement or document, the following rules shall be used to resolve the inconsistency or discrepancy: if the inconsistency or discrepancy relates to the services provided under this Futures Agreement, the terms of this Futures Agreement shall govern; if the inconsistency or discrepancy relates specifically to an additional product, program, or service, the terms of the agreement or document for that product, program, or service shall govern. In consideration of E*TRADE Futures (as a futures commission merchant registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")) accepting one or more accounts of the undersigned (“Client”) (if more than one account is carried for Client by E*TRADE Futures, all are covered by this Futures Agreement and are referred to collectively as the “Account”) and E*TRADE Futures’ agreement to act as Client’s futures commission merchant for the execution, clearance, and/or carrying of transactions for the purchase and sale of futures contracts and futures options contracts for the Account (each, a “Contract,” and collectively “Contracts”), it is agreed as follows:<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></span>

<p>TRADING FUTURES AND FUTURES OPTIONS CONTRACTS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE. CERTAIN FUTURES AND FUTURES OPTIONS CONTRACTS MAY TRADE OR SETTLE BELOW ZERO OR AT NEGATIVE PRICING, AND TRADING IN FUTURES AND FUTURES OPTIONS CONTRACTS IS APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR THOSE CLIENTS WHO UNDERSTAND AND ARE WILLING TO ASSUME THE ECONOMIC, LEGAL, AND OTHER RISKS INVOLVED AND ARE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO ASSUME LOSSES SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING THE VALUE OF ANY MARGINS OR DEPOSITS. THE LOW MARGIN DEPOSITS ASSOCIATED WITH VOLATILE PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE MARKET FOR FUTURES AND FUTURES OPTIONS CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN RAPID AND SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. CLIENT MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF FUNDS THAT CLIENT DEPOSITS WITH E*TRADE FUTURES OR AN AFFILIATE TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN A POSITION IN THE FUTURES AND FUTURES OPTIONS CONTRACTS, AND CLIENT MAY INCUR LOSSES BEYOND THESE AMOUNTS. MOREOVER, IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST CLIENT’S POSITION, CLIENT MAY BE CALLED UPON BY E*TRADE FUTURES (OR MSSB) TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN FUNDS ON SHORT NOTICE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CLIENT’S POSITION. IF CLIENT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED FUNDS WITHIN THE TIME REQUIRED BY E*TRADE FUTURES (OR MSSB), CLIENT’S POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND CLIENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN CLIENT’S ACCOUNT. NO ONE (INCLUDING ANY FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT, INTRODUCING BROKER, ASSOCIATED PERSON, AUTHORIZED AGENT, FUND MANAGER, OR COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR) CAN GUARANTEE PROFITS OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY LOSSES.</p>

            <span><p><b>2. Authorization</b> – Client authorizes E*TRADE Futures to purchase and sell Contracts for Client’s Account in accordance with Client’s instructions. Client agrees that E*TRADE Futures shall be entitled to rely on any instruction, notice or communication that it reasonably believes to have originated from Client or Client’s Authorized Agent and Client shall be bound thereby. Client hereby waives any defense that any such instructions were not in writing as may be required under Applicable Law. All orders accepted by E*TRADE Futures for handling are, at all times, subject to prevailing market conditions. In addition, in the case of market orders, certain order routers and exchanges may process or match orders through conversion to marketable limit orders for order protection, order matching, and other purposes. Accordingly, E*TRADE Futures does not guarantee that any particular order will be filled or filled at a particular price, within a particular timeframe, or at all. </p>
<p>The services provided by E*TRADE Futures hereunder may be provided directly by E*TRADE Futures or through a third party, including by means of an omnibus clearing arrangement with another futures commission merchant or using a third party that is a member of any exchange of which E*TRADE Futures is not a member to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. E*TRADE Futures is authorized to make such arrangements in its discretion with such third parties without further authorization from Client.  E*TRADE Futures routes client orders to its affiliate futures commission merchant Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for execution and clearing for which it pays Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC remuneration on a per contract basis and may pose a conflict of interest.  </p>
<p><b>3. Applicable Rules and Regulations</b> – The Account and each transaction therein shall be subject to Applicable Law. E*TRADE Futures’ failure to comply with Applicable Law in any way shall not constitute a breach of this Futures Agreement or relieve Client of its Obligations. In no event will E*TRADE Futures be obligated to effect any transaction or act on any instruction that it believes would violate Applicable Law. E*TRADE Futures shall not be liable to Client as a result of any action or inaction by E*TRADE Futures, its officers, directors, employees or agents to comply with Applicable Law.</p>
<p><b>4. Payments to E*TRADE Futures </b>– Client agrees to pay to E*TRADE Futures immediately on request (a) commissions, fees, and service charges as are in effect from time to time together with all applicable regulatory and self-regulatory organization and exchange fees and charges; (b) the amount of any debit balance, Margin obligation or any other liability that may result from transactions executed for the Account; (c) interest on such debit balance or liability at the prevailing rate charged by E*TRADE Futures at the time such debit balance or liability arises and service charges on any such debit balance or liability, together with any reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in collecting any such debit balance or liability; and (d) the amount necessary to hold E*TRADE Futures harmless against all taxes, including interest, penalties and additions thereto (“Taxes”), and all contractual and other liabilities in respect of Taxes, arising in connection with the Account or Client’s transactions hereunder including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any liability E*TRADE Futures may have to a clearing house in respect of Taxes or to a taxing authority in respect of a payment to or from a clearing house and (ii) Taxes imposed on a payment made pursuant to this Section 4(d). E*TRADE Futures reserves the right to negotiate different fees and charges than those included in any fee schedule published by E*TRADE Futures, if applicable, or elsewhere, including variable-rate commissions and interest charges and also reserves the right to charge commissions at other rates to other Clients.</p>

            <span><p><b>5. Client’s Duty to Maintain Adequate Margin – </b>Client shall at all times and without prior notice or demand from E*TRADE Futures maintain adequate Margin balances in the Account so as to continually meet the original and maintenance Margin requirements established by E*TRADE Futures for Client. E*TRADE Futures may change such requirements from time to time at E*TRADE Futures’ discretion. Such Margin requirements may exceed the Margin requirements set by any exchange or other regulatory authority and may vary from E*TRADE Futures’ requirements for other Clients. Client agrees, when so requested, promptly to transfer Margin funds to E*TRADE Futures in accordance with E*TRADE Futures’ Margin requirements and to furnish E*TRADE Futures with any additional information as may be requested by E*TRADE Futures in relation to the transfer of funds. Client agrees to promptly meet all Margin calls or cure any Margin deficiency in any manner as E*TRADE Futures designates, at its sole discretion, including by wire transfer initiated on the same Business Day on which such Margin call is made. Any deposits or funds remitted to E*TRADE Futures are deemed made or received only when cleared funds are actually received by E*TRADE Futures. E*TRADE Futures’ failure to demand satisfaction of a Margin call promptly on any occasion shall not be deemed to be a waiver of its right to do so in the future. Client acknowledges and agrees that E*TRADE Futures may receive and retain as its own any interest, increment, profit, gain or benefit, directly or indirectly, accruing from permitted investments (made in accordance with and subject to CFTC Regulations) of any of the funds E*TRADE Futures receives from Client.</p>
<p><b>6. Delivery</b></p>
<p>a) As a general matter, E*TRADE Futures does not permit physical delivery of commodities (including digital assets) and expressly prohibits physical delivery on any Contract held to maturity. E*TRADE Futures reserves the right, without notice to Client, not to make or take delivery on any Contract that settles through physical delivery. Client acknowledges and agrees that E*TRADE Futures shall have no obligation to make or take delivery on Client’s behalf and Client shall be required to liquidate or arrange for the transfer of any such Contract sufficiently before the first notice day or the last trading day (as applicable) for the relevant Contract to ensure that E*TRADE Futures incurs no delivery obligation with respect to such Contract, but in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to such first notice day or last trading day (as applicable). In the event that Client fails by such deadline to liquidate or transfer a physically settled Contract, Client hereby instructs and authorizes E*TRADE Futures to liquidate such Contract by offset for the sole and entire risk and loss of Client’s Account. Client further understands and agrees that Client may be prohibited from holding contracts to maturity or settlement and trading to the nearest expiration date for a futures or futures options contract (also referred to as front, near, or spot month trading), the result of which may result in forced liquidation of Client’s position by E*TRADE Futures. Although E*TRADE Futures has the ability in its discretion to take delivery, E*TRADE Futures shall at no time assume the obligation or otherwise be obligated to do so. You agree not to hold E*TRADE Futures liable for any Losses arising out of or relating to your failure to act or to give instructions to E*TRADE Futures to act on your behalf in respect of physical delivery on a Contract held for the Account.</p>
<p>b) Although E*TRADE Futures does not permit physical delivery of commodities (including digital assets) and expressly prohibits physical delivery on any Contract held to maturity, the following provisions shall apply to physically settled Contracts with respect to which E*TRADE Futures may in its sole discretion be prepared to make or take delivery of a commodity underlying a Contract held for the Account. Client acknowledges that the making or accepting of delivery pursuant to a Contract may involve a much higher degree of risk than liquidating a position by offset. E*TRADE Futures has no control over and makes no warranty with respect to grade, quality, tolerances or equivalent terms of any commodity delivered in fulfillment of any Contract hereunder.</p>
<p>c) Client understands that liquidating instructions on open Contracts maturing in a current month must be given to E*TRADE Futures at least five Business Days prior to the first notice day in the case of long positions and, in the case of short positions, at least five business days prior to the last trading day.</p>
<p>d) In the case of E*TRADE Futures’ inability to deliver any security, commodity or other property to the purchaser by reason of failure of Client to supply E*TRADE Futures therewith, then and in such event, Client authorizes E*TRADE Futures to borrow or buy any security, commodity or other property necessary to make delivery thereof at Client’s expense. Client agrees to be responsible for any Losses which E*TRADE Futures may incur in connection with any action taken by E*TRADE Futures in connection with an obligation to make or take delivery on a Contract held by E*TRADE Futures for Client’s Account.</p>

            <span><p><b>7. Futures Options</b></p>
<p>a) E*TRADE Futures shall not have any obligation to exercise any long futures option Contract unless Client has furnished E*TRADE Futures with timely exercise instructions and sufficient initial Margin with respect to each underlying futures contract. Client understands that some exchanges and clearing houses have established cut off times for the tender of futures option exercise instructions and that a futures option will become worthless if instructions are not delivered before such expiration time. Client understands that Client is responsible at all times to notify E*TRADE Futures of Client’s intent to exercise a futures option no later than 3:15 p.m. Central Time on the business day prior to the last day of trading for that futures option; that E*TRADE Futures’ date and time for the tendering of exercise instructions may be different than those set by any exchange, board of trade, market, or clearinghouse; and that failure to provide E*TRADE Futures with any instruction may constitute an abandonment of the futures option, and the Client’s futures option may become worthless in the event that they do not deliver instructions prior to E*TRADE Futures’ established expiration times. Client also understands that certain exchanges and clearing houses automatically exercise some “in-the-money” futures options unless instructed otherwise. Client acknowledges full responsibility for taking action either to exercise or to prevent the automatic exercise of a futures option Contract, as the case may be, and E*TRADE Futures is not required to take any action with respect to a futures option Contract, including without limitation, any action to exercise a futures option prior to its expiration date or to prevent its automatic exercise, except upon Client’s express instructions.</p>
<p>b) Client understands that all short futures option positions are subject to assignment at any time, including positions established on the same day that exercises are assigned, and that assignment notices are allocated among E*TRADE Futures’ Clients’ short futures options positions which are subject to assignment. Client understands that E*TRADE Futures may not be able to notify Client that a position was exercised prior to the opening of the next trading session, although E*TRADE Futures will undertake reasonable efforts to do so. Exercise and assignment notices are allocated randomly among all short futures options positions subject to exercise. If the Client fails to timely provide E*TRADE Futures with any required instruction, E*TRADE Futures is authorized, at its sole discretion, to exercise or liquidate all or any portion of the futures option for the Account and at the Client’s risk. Client agrees to be responsible for any Losses which E*TRADE Futures may incur in connection with any action taken by E*TRADE Futures in connection with an obligation to exercise a futures option Contract held by E*TRADE Futures for Client’s Account.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> <b>Position Limits</b></p>
<p>a) Client agrees that E*TRADE Futures, in its discretion, may from time to time establish trading limits for Client’s Account and may limit the number of open Contracts (net or gross) which Client may execute, clear, or carry with or acquire through the Account. Client agrees (i) not to make any trade which would have the effect of exceeding such limits, (ii) that E*TRADE Futures may, at any time in its sole discretion, require Client to reduce open Contracts, and (iii) that E*TRADE Futures may, at any time in its sole discretion, refuse to accept orders to establish new positions. E*TRADE Futures may impose and enforce such limits, require Client to reduce open Contracts, and refuse to accept orders to establish new positions in its sole discretion and without regard to whether any such action is required under Applicable Law.</p>
<p>b) Client shall comply with all position limits established under Applicable Law. In addition, Client agrees to notify E*TRADE Futures promptly if Client is required to file position reports with the CFTC, any regulatory or self-regulatory organization, including any exchange, and agrees to provide E*TRADE Futures with copies of any such report. E*TRADE Futures expressly disclaims any liability for Client’s Losses related to Client’s exceeding any trading limit applicable to the Account. Client acknowledges and agrees that E*TRADE Futures has no obligation to monitor Client’s trading for compliance with trading limits other than as required by Applicable Law.</p>

            <span><p><b>9. Limits on E*TRADE Futures’ Duties; Liability</b> – Client agrees:</p>
<p>a) that E*TRADE Futures is not acting as a fiduciary, commodity trading advisor, investment adviser or commodity pool operator with respect to Client or any Contract or Account and E*TRADE Futures shall have no responsibility for compliance with any Applicable Law governing the conduct of any such fiduciary or advisor or for Client’s compliance with any Applicable Law governing or affecting Client’s trading hereunder;</p>
<p>b) that if Client has authorized an Authorized Agent to place orders or effect transactions in Contracts on behalf of Client in any Account, such Authorized Agent has been selected by Client based on Client’s own evaluation and assessment of such party; and</p>
<p>c) to waive any and all claims, rights or causes of action which Client has or may have against E*TRADE Futures or its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates for or in connection with (i) indirect, consequential, punitive, or special damages or (ii) any Loss of any kind caused, directly or indirectly, by any Force Majeure Event.</p>
<p><b>10. Consent to Take the Other Side of Orders</b> – Without its prior notice, Client agrees that when E*TRADE Futures executes sell or buy orders on Client’s behalf, E*TRADE Futures, its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and any floor broker may take the other side of Client’s order for the account of such person subject to such order being executed in accordance with and subject to the limitations and conditions, if any, contained in Applicable Law. This consent shall remain in effect until Client delivers written notice to E*TRADE Futures revoking such consent.</p>
<p><b>11. Automated Systems</b> – The Client consents to E*TRADE Futures’ use of automated systems or service bureaus in conjunction with: the receipt and handling of orders; the reporting of order acknowledgments, cancellations, and executions; the clearing and settlement of transactions for the Account; tax and cost basis reporting; the delivery of information with respect to Collateral; and similar recordkeeping and reporting services and account reconciliation and risk management (collectively, “Automated Systems”). Client understands that the use of Automated Systems entails risks, including but not limited to interruption of service, systems or communications failures, delays in service, cyberattacks, and errors in the design or functionality of such Automated Systems that could cause substantial damage, expense, or liability to the Client. The Client understands and agrees that E*TRADE Futures does not guarantee uninterrupted access to futures brokerage or other Services that E*TRADE Futures may offer from time to time. Client further acknowledges that pending orders submitted to any exchange may be cancelled upon loss of connection to such exchange and that orders submitted to an exchange may be outside of that exchange’s established price parameters and such order may therefore fail to be submitted. E*TRADE Futures reserves the right to suspend access to any Services it provides without prior notice during scheduled or unscheduled system repairs or upgrades and to modify any Service it provides at any time without prior notice. Client authorizes E*TRADE Futures to place orders for Contracts in accordance with its instructions through one or more Automated Systems maintained or operated by E*TRADE Futures, or by or under the auspices of, any exchange.</p>
<p>E*TRADE FUTURES MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SELECTION, DESIGN, SECURITY, FUNCTIONALITY, OPERATION, TITLE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY AUTOMATED SYSTEM. E*TRADE FUTURES MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, E*TRADE FUTURES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION THAT ANY AUTOMATED SYSTEM WILL OPERATE UNINTERUPTED OR BE ERROR-FREE. E*TRADE FUTURES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED TO CLIENT FOR ANY LOSSES INCURRED OR SUSTAINED BY CLIENT AND ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM ANY FAULT, DELAY, OMISSION, INACCURACY OR TERMINATION OF ANY AUTOMATED SYSTEM OR FROM E*TRADE FUTURES’ INABILITY TO ENTER, CANCEL OR MODIFY AN ORDER ON BEHALF OF CLIENT ON OR THROUGH AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM. CLIENT AGREES TO HOLD E*TRADE FUTURES HARMLESS FROM AND TO INDEMNIFY E*TRADE FUTURES FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM ANY SUCH EVENT.</p>

In addition, if Client has not received a written confirmation that a Contract has been executed within three business days after Client has placed an order with E*TRADE Futures to effect such transaction, and has been informed or believes that such order has been or should have been executed, then Client immediately shall notify E*TRADE Futures. Thereafter, absent such notice, Client conclusively shall be deemed estopped to object and to have waived any such objection to the failure to execute, or cause to be executed such transaction.

            <span><p><b>15. Security Interest and Transfer of Funds</b></p>
<p>a) Client hereby assigns, pledges and transfers to E*TRADE Futures and grants to E*TRADE Futures, and to any of its affiliates that may from time to time hold Contracts or Collateral for or on behalf of Client in connection with the execution or clearing of any transaction in such Contracts or settlement or custody of such Collateral, a continuing security interest in, right of set off to, and continuing first priority lien on all of Client’s right, title and interest (in each case whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired) in (i) the Account and all assets (including security entitlements, commodity contracts, financial assets, proceeds and investment property (each as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”), as amended) credited thereto, including assets held by any clearing organization in respect of Contracts, as well as other property of Client (including any securities accounts, commodity accounts, security entitlements, commodity contracts, financial assets and investment property (each as defined in the UCC)) held in respect of Contracts by or for E*TRADE Futures, any clearing organization or any agent acting for E*TRADE Futures in connection with any transaction in Contracts, whether held jointly or individually; (ii) Client’s Contracts and all rights to payment thereunder; (iii) all money and/or cash of any currency deposited in or credited to the Account; and (iv) all products and proceeds of the foregoing. The foregoing grant of security secures, to the extent permissible by Applicable Law, all Obligations of Client now or hereafter owing to E*TRADE Futures or to any affiliate of E*TRADE Futures, including, without limitation, all Losses incurred by E*TRADE Futures in connection with the enforcement of this Futures Agreement and the security interest created hereunder. The foregoing security interest in the Collateral is hereby assigned, pledged and transferred as well to any affiliate of E*TRADE Futures that may from time to time hold Contracts or Collateral for or on behalf of Client in connection with the execution or clearing of any transaction in such Contracts or settlement or custody of such Collateral. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, E*TRADE Futures shall have and may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it pursuant to Applicable Law, at law or in equity, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under such applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to, the UCC, whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral, to the fullest extent permitted under such Applicable Law. Client agrees to execute any documents reasonably required by E*TRADE Futures for the perfection or negotiation of such general lien or security interest. The Client shall pay the fees for any filing, registration, recording, or perfection of any security interest contemplated by this Futures Agreement and pay, or cause to be paid, from the Account any and all taxes imposed on the Collateral by any authority. Client acknowledges that E*TRADE Futures and certain of its affiliates have entered into an Intercompany Control Agreement under which Collateral could be made available to satisfy Client’s obligations to one or more such affiliates upon a default or termination event in respect Client’s account relationship with such affiliate.</p>
<p>b) All Collateral upon delivery to E*TRADE Futures shall be free and clear of all prior liens, claims, and encumbrances (other than liens solely in favor of E*TRADE Futures), and the Client will not cause or allow any of the Collateral, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, mortgages, or encumbrances of any nature other than security interests solely in E*TRADE Futures’ favor. Furthermore, Collateral consisting of securities and other property shall be in Good Deliverable Form (or E*TRADE Futures shall have the power to place such securities in Good Deliverable Form), in accordance with the requirements of the primary market or markets for such securities.</p>
<p>c) From time to time, E*TRADE Futures may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Client, and at all times subject to Applicable Law, apply and transfer any funds or Collateral interchangeably between any of Client’s Accounts at E*TRADE Futures (including accounts maintained by E*TRADE with an affiliate or third party on Client’s behalf), as may be necessary in order to satisfy applicable Margin requirements or to satisfy or reduce any deficit or debit balance in any such Account. Within a reasonable time after such transfer, E*TRADE Futures will confirm such transfer in writing to Client. Client agrees to provide such funds or Collateral in such amount and in such form as E*TRADE Futures may require from time to time, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>d) Client’s Account and Collateral carried by E*TRADE Futures shall be segregated as required by Applicable Law, including without limitation the CEA and the CFTC Regulations, including the provisions of CFTC Regulation 1.20, which requires E*TRADE Futures to separately account for its clients’ funds and segregate such funds as belonging to its clients, apart from its own.  Accounts carried by employees of Morgan Stanley who directly support the E*TRADE Futures business are not considered client funds and thus, will not be segregated from E*TRADE Futures own funds or entitled to the same protections afforded to clients under CFTC Regulation 1.20 and other Applicable Law regarding segregation of client funds.  Subject to such client funds segregation requirements, Client hereby acknowledges that E*TRADE Futures may from time to time and without notice to Client, make permitted investments of Collateral in accordance with and at all times subject to the requirements of CFTC Regulations. Client further agrees and acknowledges that, to the extent Client deposits securities, warehouse receipts or other negotiable instruments with E*TRADE Futures, E*TRADE Futures shall not at any time be required to deliver to Client identical property in return, but may fulfill its obligations to Client by delivery of property of like or equivalent kind or amount.</p>
<p>e) For purposes of Articles 8 and 9 of the UCC and any similar legislation in any other applicable jurisdiction, (i) E*TRADE Futures is a securities intermediary or commodity intermediary, as applicable, with respect to the Accounts and the Contracts, and the jurisdiction of E*TRADE Futures or any of its affiliates as securities intermediary or commodity intermediary with respect to the Account and the Contracts is New York, (ii) the Account is a “securities account,” a “futures account,” and a “commodity account,” and (iii) any property of any nature whatsoever credited or receivable to the Account is a “financial asset” and “investment property.”</p>
<p>f) E*TRADE Futures’ security interest in the Collateral shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the payment and performance in full of the Client’s Obligations; (ii) be binding on the Client, its successors, and permitted assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, E*TRADE Futures and its respective successors, transferees, and assigns (including any affiliate that is party to the Intercompany Control Agreement).</p>
<p>g) In addition to and without limiting E*TRADE Futures’ rights under this Agreement or under the Self-Directed Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default arising under Section 16(d) or 16(g) hereof, any and all obligations owed to E*TRADE Futures shall (to the extent not already due and payable) become immediately due and payable. E*TRADE Futures may (1) liquidate, terminate, or accelerate the Client’s open position in whole or in part, and/or (2) set-off (including by set-off, offset, netting, combination of accounts, deduction, counterclaim, retention, or withholding across or within each or all of the positions) E*TRADE Futures obligation to the Client against the Client’s obligations to E*TRADE Futures, or apply or set-off margin posted in favor of the Client against E*TRADE Futures obligations to the Client.</p>
<p>h) E*TRADE Futures endeavors to comply with Applicable Law with respect to each particular Account that it custodies for Client and, in consequence, will not exercise any of its rights under this Futures Agreement or any other agreement with Client if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law. In particular, separate and distinct rules apply to tax qualified accounts (i.e., Traditional, Roth, Rollover, Inherited, SEP, SAR-SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs, any VIP, RPM, or other accounts that hold qualified plan assets, or any Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (collectively, “Retirement and Education Savings Accounts”)), and thus, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Futures Agreement, and of any other agreement entered into by and between Client and E*TRADE Futures or any affiliate of E*TRADE Futures, E*TRADE Futures will not look to Retirement and Education Savings Accounts to satisfy any Obligation that exists in connection with any other account that E*TRADE Futures maintains for Client, and nor will E*TRADE Futures look to such other accounts to satisfy any Obligation that exists in connection with any Retirement and Education Savings Accounts. Furthermore, E*TRADE Futures will not take into account any Retirement and Education Savings Accounts in determining available Margin credit or in connection with exercising its Margin requirement rights under any account of a different type (i.e., accounts which are not “tax qualified”), or vice versa, as set forth in this Futures Agreement or otherwise. To the extent such provisions or the application thereof would constitute a prohibited transaction or conflict with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code and any other Applicable Law that governs Retirement and Education Savings Accounts, specifically including any guidance on “cross-collateralization,” such provisions shall be hereby deemed null and void.</p>

At any time at MSSB’s sole discretion and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, MSSB may transfer any cash, securities, commodity contracts, financial assets, or other property from any Account in which the Client has an interest to any other Account in which the Client has an interest, regardless of whether there are other Clients on either Account and MSSB may transfer property between any sub-accounts of the Account. In addition, MSSB may, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, transfer property from the Account to any commodity, futures, or other account carried by E*TRADE Futures in which the Client has an interest, to the extent necessary to satisfy any margin call by MSSB, and E*TRADE Futures may transfer Property from the account to any securities or other account carried by MSSB in which the Client has an interest, to the extent necessary to satisfy any margin call by E*TRADE Futures.

<p>f) Client breaches any position limit applicable to the Account;</p>

<p><b>18. Client Representations, Warranties and Agreements –</b> Client represents and warrants to and agrees with E*TRADE Futures that:</p>
<p>a) Client, if an individual, is of legal age and competence to enter into this Futures Agreement and to transact in Contracts consistent with and subject to its terms and conditions;</p>
<p>b) Client, if a legal entity, is duly organized, validly existing, and empowered to enter into this Agreement, to establish the Account, to enter into transactions in Contracts as contemplated hereby and that such transactions do not violate any of Client’s constituent documents and that the person executing this Futures Agreement on its behalf has been duly and validly authorized under Applicable Law to do so;</p>
<p>c) Neither Client nor any partner, director, officer, member, manager or employee of Client nor any affiliate of Client is a partner, director, officer, member, manager or employee of a futures commission merchant, broker-dealer, introducing broker, or regulatory or self-regulatory organization except as previously disclosed in writing to E*TRADE Futures;</p>
<p>d) Except as previously disclosed in writing to E*TRADE Futures, Client (or its Authorized Agent, as applicable) (i) is not a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor and Client is acting solely as principal and no one other than the Client has an interest in the Account or (ii) is a registered commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor, or (iii) is otherwise exempt from registration under CFTC Regulations and if exempt, Client (or Authorized Agent) has properly listed its exemption in accordance with Applicable Law requirements. Client (or Authorized Agent) agrees to notify E*TRADE Futures of the identity of any other person or entity that controls the trading of the Account, has a financial interest of 10% or more in the Account (or in any Authorized Agent), or the identity of any other Account which the Client (or Authorized Agent) controls or in which Client (or Authorized Agent) has a 10% or greater ownership interest;</p>
<p>e) E*TRADE Futures is under no obligation to accept any account as a “hedge account” or to extend favorable Margin treatment to any such account or transaction executed in such account;</p>
<p>f) If Client’s Account is a hedging account as defined under CFTC Regulations, Client has so designated the Account and notified E*TRADE Futures of such designation;</p>

<p>j) Client understands and agrees that marketing materials, educational materials, market data, research, statements of investment philosophy and principles, descriptions of strategies and risks, and generic advice are not recommendations and are incidental to the conduct of E*TRADE Futures’ business as an FCM and such communications shall not serve as the primary basis for any decision made by or on behalf of Client in connection with its transactions in Contracts;</p>
<p>k) Client understands and agrees that, apart from the right to liquidate Client’s account pursuant to this Agreement, E*TRADE Futures shall have no discretionary authority, power or control over any decisions made by or on behalf of Client in respect of the Account, regardless of whether Client relies on the advice of E*TRADE Futures in making any such decision;</p>
<p>l) Client understands and agrees that E*TRADE Futures is not acting hereunder as a municipal advisor within the meaning of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act;</p>
<p>m) Absent a separate written agreement between Client and E*TRADE Futures with respect to “give-up” transactions, E*TRADE Futures, in its discretion, may, but shall have no obligation to, accept from other brokers Contracts executed by such brokers for Client and proposed to be “given up” to E*TRADE Futures for clearance and/or carrying in the Account; if E*TRADE Futures does accept such Contracts, Client authorizes E*TRADE Futures to pay and charge to Client’s Account any give-up or give-in fee that may be charged by any exchange or clearing house or by an executing firm or broker whom Client or its agents have authorized to execute transactions for Client’s Account;</p>

Client further acknowledges that pending orders submitted to any exchange may be cancelled upon loss of connection to such exchange and that orders submitted to an exchange may be outside of that exchange’s established price parameters and such order may therefore fail to be submitted. With respect to the preceding sentence, Client will not hold E*TRADE Futures liable for losses, actual or perceived, that may arise from such loss of connection. The provisions of this Section 18(n) shall apply regardless of whether any Client claim arises in contract, negligence, tort, strict liability, breach of fiduciary obligations or otherwise;</p>
<p>o) If the Client maintains separate accounts in which, pursuant to applicable CFTC Regulations, offsetting positions are not closed out, E*TRADE Futures hereby advises the Client that any offsetting long and short hedge position held open in separate accounts may result in the Client being charged additional fees and commissions and the payment of additional Margin;</p>

<p>q) The accompanying Futures Account Application (including any financial statements furnished in connection therewith) is true, correct and complete, and will be promptly updated by Client to reflect any material changes.</p>
<p>Client agrees to promptly notify E*TRADE Futures in writing if any of the warranties and representations contained in this Section 18 becomes inaccurate or in any way ceases to be true, complete and correct.</p>
