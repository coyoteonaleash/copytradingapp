            <span><p>The Employer identified in the [Application] or other account opening document (the “Application”) wishes to adopt a qualified retirement plan (the “Plan”) using a prototype retirement plan document (the “Plan Document”) made available by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (the “Custodian”) or an affiliate. The Employer, the Trustee (if applicable), and the Participant (if applicable) identified in the Application (collectively, the “Clients”) wish to establish a brokerage account(s) (the “Account”) to be used in conjunction with the Plan, and engage the Custodian to perform certain directed and ministerial processing and related services as more fully described herein. The Custodian is willing to provide such products and services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement (the “Agreement”).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Employer, the Trustee, (if applicable), the Participant (if applicable) and the Custodian agree as follows:<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>
</span>
        </div>

<div class="richTextEditor aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12"><div>
    
    
    
    
    
        <div style=",,">
            <span><h3><span class="span-block vertical-offset-base">Article I — General</span></h3>
<p>1.1 The Clients represent and warrant that the Plan is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) with a related trust that is exempt from tax under Code section 501(a) (“Qualified Trust”) (or a custodial arrangement under Code section 401(f) that is treated as a Qualified Trust).</p>
<p>1.2 The Trustee or Employer, as applicable, has independently determined that the terms of the Application and this Agreement comply with the terms of the Plan Document for the Plan.</p>
<p>1.3 The Account will be linked to a non-transactional plan account. The plan account will be used for the Custodian’s administrative purposes only, such as maintaining plan information or linking related accounts maintained in connection with the Plan, and cannot be used for contributions, distributions, or to transact trades.</p>
<p>1.4 The Custodian and its affiliates will not serve as a Trustee, Plan Administrator, Named Fiduciary or Third-Party Administrator for the Plan. Neither the Custodian nor its affiliates shall have any duty, obligation or responsibility for the administration of the Plan or its qualification under the Internal Revenue Code except that the Custodian or an affiliate is responsible for maintaining the prototype Plan Document in a form acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. The Employer’s continued use of the prototype Plan Document is contingent upon the Plan’s maintenance of at least one funded account with the Custodian. If and when the Plan no longer maintains a funded account for the Plan with the Custodian, the Employer’s participation in the prototype Plan Document program will automatically terminate, the Plan will no longer be covered by the prototype Plan Document made available to the Employer by the Custodian or an affiliate, the Employer will not be able to rely on the IRS Opinion Letter issued to the Custodian or an affiliate in connection with the prototype Plan Document, and the Employer will be responsible for any updates that are required to maintain the Plan Document and the Plan’s tax qualified status.</p>
<p>1.5 The Clients represent and warrant that they have received and reviewed a copy of Schedule A, Allocation of Roles and Responsibilities Under Your Retirement Plan, which generally outlines the role the Custodian does and does not perform with respect to the Plan and the Account, and agree that it accurately describes the Clients’ understanding of the Custodian’s general responsibilities.</p>
<p>1.6 Clients will notify the Custodian in writing of any amendment to any Plan Documents, any change in the composition of the Trustees, or any other event which could materially alter the statements in the Application or this Agreement, and the Custodian may rely on the continued validity of this information indefinitely, absent actual receipt of such written notice.</p>
<p>1.7 If there is more than one Trustee of the Plan or authorized representative of the Employer, as applicable, any action in connection with the Account requires the authorization of only one Trustee or one authorized representative, as applicable.</p>
<p>1.8 The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, hereby covenant that if they sign and deliver to the Custodian any document which effectuates a delegation of investment management, such parties are authorized under the Plan Document and/or applicable law to delegate investment management, and that the Custodian shall have no independent duty to verify their authority to delegate investment management.</p>
<p>1.9 Each person authorized in this Agreement to act on behalf of the Plan represents and warrants that all instructions given with respect to the Account are within the authorities given by, or pursuant to, the Plan Document and agrees to jointly and severally indemnify the Custodian and its affiliates, employees and agents from any and all liabilities that may be incurred by virtue of acting on said instructions. Such parties shall be under no obligation to inquire into the purpose of any instruction given including but not limited to the delivery of securities or other property or the payment of money either to an authorized representative of the Plan or any third party and shall not be bound to see to the application or disposition of said securities, other property or money. In the event of the death or removal of an authorized representative, the remaining authorized representatives shall immediately give the Custodian written notice thereof and the Custodian may, before or after receiving such notice, take such proceedings, require such documents, retain such portion of the Account and/or restrict transactions in the Account as the Custodian may deem advisable to protect against any real or perceived liabilities. The Plan shall remain liable to the Custodian for any debt or loss in the Account resulting from transactions initiated prior to the Custodian’s receipt of written notice of such death or removal including, but not limited to, losses or debts resulting from such transactions.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a) Contributions (including salary deferral contributions) made by the employer in accordance with the Plan;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b) Rollover contributions consisting of (i) cash and/or other property distributed from an eligible retirement plan as defined under Code Section 402(c)(8)(B), provided that such property is of a nature and in a form acceptable to the Custodian; or (ii) the cash proceeds of the sale of property distributed from such eligible retirement plan, in accordance with Code Sections 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 403(b)(10), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16), if the distribution is received from a eligible retirement plan other than an individual retirement plan defined in Code Section 7701(a)(37);</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c) Trustee-to-trustee transfers, provided such property being transferred is of a nature and in a form acceptable to the Custodian;</p>

<p>3.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Custodian, the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, shall direct the investments in the Account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a) The Account is a Participant-Directed Account. The Participant (or, in the event of the Participant’s death, the Beneficiary) will have the authority to trade in the Account and the Trustee or Employer, as applicable, will also have the authority to trade in the Account as the authorized representative of the Plan. The Trustee or Employer, as applicable, is responsible for ensuring that all account transaction and investment instructions provided are in accordance with the Plan Documents.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b) Such investments may be made in</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">i. securities and other investments that are available for acquisition through the Custodian in its regular course of business and permitted by the Custodian for investment under the Account according to its policies and procedures then in effect; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">ii. other investments the Custodian in its sole discretion agrees to hold according to its policies and procedures then in effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c) The Custodian’s decision to permit the holding of any investment in the Account shall not constitute approval of the investment merits of the investment nor a judgment as to the prudence, advisability or appropriateness of the investment.</p>

<p>4.1 In General.<b> </b>The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, may direct a distribution or transfer of all or a portion of the Account at any time and from time to time in such form and in such manner as is acceptable to the Custodian. In accordance with Article V, the Beneficiary (as defined in Article V) may in the event of the Participant’s death direct a distribution or transfer of all or a portion of the Beneficiary’s share of the Account in such form and in such manner as is acceptable to the Custodian. A distribution or transfer shall be made only upon notification to the Custodian pursuant to this Section 4.1 and the Custodian shall act upon such direction within a reasonable period to the extent possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a) The Custodian is not required to make any distribution or transfer from this Account until directed on a form provided by, and delivered to, the Custodian for that purpose or in such other medium as shall be acceptable to the Custodian. Such directions shall include, but not be limited to, an identification of the Account, the amount of cash or specific securities or other property to be distributed or transferred, the order in which securities or other property held in the Account shall be liquidated, if necessary, the nature or purpose of the distribution or transfer, the party to whom the distribution or transfer shall be made, whether income taxes are to be withheld, if necessary, and such other information and representations as the Custodian may require in its sole discretion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b) The Custodian may condition any distribution or transfer upon receipt of any and all applications, certificates, tax waivers, signature guarantees and other documents (including proof of any legal representative’s authority) deemed necessary or advisable by the Custodian, in the Custodian’s sole judgment.</p>

            <span><h3><span class="span-block vertical-offset-base">Article V — Beneficiary Designation and Distribution upon Death of Participant</span></h3>
<p>5.1 The Employer is solely responsible for reviewing and confirming that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the terms of the Plan Document and, by executing the Application, the Employer represents and warrants that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the terms of the Plan. Further, the Employer is solely responsible for informing the Custodian of any changes to the terms of the Plan that may impact the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>5.2 The Employer directs Custodian to collect and maintain,<b> </b>on behalf of the Plan, beneficiary designations submitted by the Participant in a form and manner acceptable to the Employer as described herein. Accordingly, the Employer directs the Custodian to collect and maintain beneficiary designations submitted by the Participant in accordance with the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a) The Participant may designate one or more primary or contingent beneficiaries (collectively, “Beneficiary” or “Beneficiaries”) to receive all or a specified portion of the Account in the event of the Participant’s death, using the E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley Designation of Beneficiary for Qualified Retirement Plan Form (or successor form) or the electronic equivalent of such form (the “Designation of Beneficiary Form”).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b) The Participant may designate an individual, trust, the Participant’s estate, charitable organization or other entity as a Beneficiary of the Account. The Participant must identify the Beneficiary with sufficient specificity and in an acceptable manner. Designations that include “per will” or “per trust” or substantially similar language will be considered invalid.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c) If the Participant is married and wishes to designate a primary beneficiary who is not their spouse, their spouse must consent to such designation on the Designation of Beneficiary Form, and the spouse’s consent must acknowledge the effect of such designation and be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. If the Participant designates a primary beneficiary while they are not married, but in the future the Participant becomes married, the Participant must complete a new Designation of Beneficiary Form to continue to designate a primary beneficiary who is not their spouse, and their spouse must consent to such designation on the Designation of Beneficiary Form in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">d) No Designation of Beneficiary Form shall be effective until received by the Custodian in acceptable form. The Participant may change or revoke the Designation of Beneficiary Form at any time by completing and delivering a new Designation of Beneficiary Form in acceptable form, but such change or revocation shall not be effective until received by the Custodian. The last dated and signed Designation of Beneficiary Form actually received by the Custodian in an acceptable form during the lifetime of the Participant will govern.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">e) In the case of multiple Beneficiaries, the Participant must identify the percentage of the Account each Beneficiary is entitled to receive. The percentages for all of the primary beneficiaries must total 100%, and the percentage for all of the contingent beneficiaries must total 100%. If the Participant fails to identify the percentage each Beneficiary is entitled to receive, each Beneficiary shall be entitled to an equal share of the Account.</p>
<p>5.3 If the Participant dies before the entire Account has been paid to them, the Employer directs the Custodian to pay the remaining balance of the Account in accordance with the Designation of Beneficiary Form to the surviving Beneficiary(ies) designated by the Participant, subject to any conditions specified herein or in the Designation of Beneficiary Form. If no Beneficiary designated by the Participant on the Designation of Beneficiary Form survives the Participant, the Employer directs the Custodian to pay the remaining balance of the Account to the Participant’s spouse, or where no Spouse exists, to the Participant’s estate.</p>
<p>5.4 Unless the Beneficiaries jointly agree to an alternative division of the specific securities and other property held in the Account, the Employer directs the Custodian to pay each Beneficiary a proportionate share of each security and other property held in this Account based on the percentage of the Account each Beneficiary is entitled to receive. Securities or other property held in the Account may be liquidated if necessary to adhere to the percentage allocated to each Beneficiary and the Custodian is authorized (but not obligated) to liquidate such securities or other positions without the consent of any or all of the beneficiaries. If the Account assets cannot be split evenly among the Beneficiaries according to the percentage the Participant allocated to each Beneficiary, the Employer directs the Custodian to pay the Beneficiary listed first on the applicable Designation of Beneficiary form a slightly higher percentage.</p>
<p>5.5 If, at the time of the Participant’s Death, the Beneficiary is a minor or incapacitated adult who is represented by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or custodian (“Beneficiary’s Nominee”), the Employer authorizes the Custodian to distribute such Beneficiary’s percentage of the Account to the Beneficiary’s Nominee and shall be fully released thereby. If no Beneficiary’s Nominee has been properly appointed, or if the Beneficiary’s Nominee is unable or refuses to accept delivery of the Beneficiary’s percentage of the Account, the Custodian may, but shall have no obligation to, seek appointment of a substitute Beneficiary’s Nominee for the sole purpose of accepting delivery of the Account assets, and shall be fully released thereby, offsetting the reasonable expenses of doing so against the Account assets.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

The appointment of the successor Custodian shall become effective at the time the resigning Custodian ceases to act. The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, may remove the Custodian at any time by giving at least 30 days written notice to the Custodian. The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, must identify the successor Custodian in the notice to the Custodian. The notice period may be waived by the party entitled to the notice.</p>
<p>8.2<b> </b>Successor Custodian or Trustee.<b></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a) If the Custodian, upon its resignation, appoints a successor custodian, the Employer or Trustee, as applicable, shall either accept the Custodian’s appointment of a successor or appoint a successor Custodian. The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, shall be deemed to have consented to, and accepted, the Custodian’s appointed successor if the Employer or Trustee, as applicable, does not appoint a successor Custodian on or before the effective date of the Custodian’s resignation (as set forth in the notice described in Section 8.1 above). The successor shall have all rights, powers, privileges, liabilities and duties of the Custodian.

<p>9.1 Amendment or Termination.<b> </b>The Custodian, or any successor custodian, may amend this Agreement or related agreements, including the Application, or terminate the Account at any time provided that notice of such amendment or termination is provided to the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, in writing. The Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, shall be deemed to have consented to any such amendment unless within the period specified in the Custodian’s notice, the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, terminates (or transfers) the Account. The termination of the Account shall not terminate the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, obligations, representations, or agreements nor the Custodian’s rights or remedies, including the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, obligation covered in Section 7.4 to indemnify the Custodian. The Custodian’s obligations under this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of this Account. Upon delivery or distribution of any assets in the Account to, or upon order of, the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, the Custodian shall be relieved from all further liability under this Custodial Agreement.<b></b></p>
<p>9.2 Distribution on Termination.<b> </b>If the Account is terminated (in whole or part) for any reason by the Custodian, the Custodian shall distribute the balance of the Account (or the portion of the Account that has been terminated) to a successor custodian or trustee appointed by the Custodian, Employer or Trustee, as applicable, or, if no such successor is appointed, in a lump sum directly to the Employer, Trustee, Participant or Beneficiary, as applicable, provided, however, that the Custodian may sell assets to satisfy any tax withholding obligations of the Custodian (in accordance with Section 6.3(f)) and exclude from any such distribution an amount deemed reasonably necessary by the Custodian for the payment of all unpaid fees, expenses, taxes, charges and any other liabilities of the Account.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

            <span><h3><span class="span-block vertical-offset-base">Article X — Fees and Expenses</span></h3>
<p>10.1 Compensation of the Custodian.<b> </b>The Custodian shall be entitled to reasonable fees and compensation for its services in maintaining the Account, implementing or completing securities or other transactions on behalf of the Account and for any other relevant services, including (but not limited to) Broker-dealer or investment advisory services, provided to the Clients in connection with the Account, along with reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the Account. The Custodian shall notify the Client in writing of its fees and of any changes in fees. The Client and the Custodian agree that the Custodian has the absolute right to amend or revise its fees as set forth in Pricing and Rates available at <a alt="View our Pricing and Rates" href="../../../what-we-offer/pricing-and-rates.html">us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/pricing-and-rates</a>, and no amendment or revision or substitution of its fees shall be deemed an amendment of this Agreement.</p>
<p>10.2 Payment of Fees and Expenses.<b> </b>The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, is responsible for paying any account, custodial, or related administrative charges the Custodian might reasonably require and disclose in connection with the process of opening or maintaining the Account. Any brokerage fees, commissions and related expenses shall be paid in the customary manner. In the event an Account is terminated or transferred, a termination or transfer fee may be due and payable on the date of the termination or transfer. Reimbursement for expenses shall be due and payable upon demand. The Custodian reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to elect to discount or waive certain fees for certain customers. To effect the payment of fees from the Account, the Custodian may liquidate assets in accordance with Section 6.3(f). The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, represents and warrants that the Plan Document allows for expenses to be paid from Plan assets. If it is subsequently determined that such payments are improperly paid from Plan assets, Employer or Trustee, as applicable, agrees to indemnify the Custodian for any and all amounts expended to correct such payments.</p>
<p>10.3 Deduction of Fees and Expenses.<b> </b>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Account shall be subject to the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of the Custodian, as described in the Agreement and any other fee schedules and documentation, as may be amended from time to time. The Custodian may deduct from and charge against the Account all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Account, provided, however, the Employer or Trustee, as applicable, may elect to pay certain fees and expenses directly to the Custodian, but if not paid timely, the Custodian will deduct such fees and expenses from the Account. To effect the payment of fees and expenses from the Account, the Custodian may liquidate assets held in the IRA in accordance with Section 6.3(f).</p>
<p>10.4 Float. Clients understand and agree that the Custodian may retain, as compensation for the performance of services, the Account’s proportionate share of any interest earned on aggregate cash balances held by the Custodian with respect to “assets awaiting investment or other processing.” This amount, known as “float,” is earned by us through investment in overnight cash deposits and highly liquid securities (e.g., U.S. government obligations), with the amount of such earnings retained by us, due to the short-term nature of the investments, being generally at the prevailing overnight interest rate applicable to these investments. This rate averaged approximately one hundred sixty-nine points during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, but please note that due to market fluctuations the rate will change – please contact us for more current information. “Assets awaiting investment or other processing” for these purposes includes, to the degree applicable: (i) new deposits to the Account, including interest and dividends; (ii) any uninvested assets held by the Account caused by an instruction to purchase or sell securities (which may, after the period described below, be automatically swept into a sweep vehicle); (iii) assets held in the Plan Account (where applicable); and (iv) withdrawals from the Account, to the degree checkwriting privileges may be offered to the Plan. With respect to assets awaiting investment or other processing: (i) where such assets are received by the Custodian on a day on which the New York Stock Exchange and/or the Federal Reserve Banks are open (“Business Day”), float shall generally be earned by us through the end of that Business Day (known as the “Sweep Date”), with the Account credited interest/dividends in such funds as of the next Business Day following the Sweep Date; or (ii) where such assets are received on a Business Day that is not followed by another Business Day, or on a day which is not a Business Day, float shall generally be earned by us through the end of the next Business Day. Delays in providing investment instruction could result in increased compensation in the form of float. Please note, however, that uninvested cash typically does not await sweep for more than one day and the Custodian does not invest, and therefore does not earn interest on, all uninvested client cash. Where the Custodian facilitates a distribution from the Account, the Custodian earns float on money set aside for payment of outstanding but uncashed checks, generally from the date on the face of the checks until the date that either the recipient cashes the check, or the check is cancelled and the underlying funds are returned to the Account. For example: If $10,000 is deposited into an Account and those funds are awaiting investment (i.e., the funds are not swept into the Bank Deposit Program, a money market fund or otherwise invested), the Custodian may earn interest or “float” on the funds (as further described above). Assuming the interest rate is 1.69%, the Custodian would earn approximately 47 cents per day ($10,000*1.69% / 360 = $0.47).</p>
<p>10.5 Payment for Order Flow and other Routing Arrangements and Use of Electronic Communication Networks and Alternative Trading Systems.</p>
<p>The Custodian is committed to providing the best execution for customers’ orders. In furtherance of this commitment, the Custodian considers several factors, including price, the available liquidity pool, execution speed, transaction costs, service and opportunities for price improvement in determining where to route customer orders for execution.</p>
<p>Industry regulations require that we disclose whether we receive compensation for directing client orders for execution to various dealers, national securities exchanges, alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including electronic communications networks (“ECNs”), and other market centers. This compensation is commonly referred to as “payment for order flow.”</p>
<p>The Custodian, either directly or indirectly, may route customer equity orders to national securities exchanges, ATSs, including ECNs, and other market centers, including its affiliate Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley & Co.”). Certain market centers offer cash credits for orders that provide liquidity to their books and charge explicit fees for orders that extract liquidity from their books (and certain market centers invert this practice). From time to time, the amount of credits that the Custodian receives from one or more such market centers may exceed the amount the Custodian is charged. The Custodian receives the benefit of these credits, either directly or indirectly, and such payments constitute payment for order flow. The Custodian may also receive incremental pricing benefits from exchanges and/or ECNs if certain volume thresholds are met.</p>
<p>In addition, Morgan Stanley & Co. may route certain customer orders (including orders for fixed income securities, preferred shares and convertible bonds) to Morgan Stanley & Co. on behalf of the Custodian. These arrangements between Morgan Stanley & Co. and the Custodian are intended to facilitate trade execution for our customers, with apportionment of resulting expenses and revenue from the trading activity between the Custodian and Morgan Stanley & Co. Morgan Stanley & Co. participates in Exchange-sponsored listed option payment for order flow programs and accepts payment for order flow for certain listed option orders. In the course of providing liquidity, Morgan Stanley & Co. may preference certain option orders to Morgan Stanley & Co.’s options market maker, or third-party market makers for execution. The Custodian and/or its affiliates have ownership interests in and/or Board seats on ECNs or other ATSs. In certain instances, the Custodian and/or its affiliates may be deemed to control one or more of such ECNs or ATSs based on the level of such ownership interests and whether the Custodian and/or its affiliates are represented on the Board of such ECNs or ATSs. The Custodian and/or its affiliates may from time to time, directly or indirectly, effect client trades through ECNs or other ATSs in which the Custodian and/or its affiliates have or may acquire an interest or Board seat, and the Custodian and/or its affiliates may thereby receive an indirect economic benefit based upon their ownership in the ECNs or other ATSs. The Custodian and/or its affiliates will, directly or indirectly, execute through an ECN or other ATS in which it has an interest only in situations where the Custodian and/or its affiliates, or the broker-dealer through whom they are accessing the ECN or ATS, reasonably believes such transaction will be in the best interest of its clients and the requirements of applicable law have been satisfied.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Custodian, subject at all times to its obligations to obtain best execution for its customers’ orders, will route certain customer order flow to Morgan Stanley & Co. Furthermore, as of December 2022, the Custodian and/or its affiliates own an interest in certain ECNs or ATSs, including: (i) National Stock Exchange of India; (ii) Miami International Holdings Inc.; (iii) Equilend; (iv) Euroclear Holding SA/NV; (v) LCH Group Holdings Limited (Clearing); (vi) CME; (vii) ICE US Holding Company, LP; (viii) OTCDeriv Limited; (ix) TIFFE – Tokyo Financial Futures Exchange; (x) iSWAP Limited; (xi) EOS Precious Metals Limited; (xii) Creditderiv Limited; (xiii) FXGlobalClear; (xiv) Japan Securities Clearing Corporation; (xv) CME/CBOT/NYMEX; (xvi) Dubai Mercantile Exchange; (xvii) Intercontinental Exchange; (xviii) Bombay Stock Exchange; (xix) Japan Securities Depository Center Inc.; (xx) MEMX Holdings LLC; (xxi) LCH.Clearnet Group LTD; (xxii) The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation; (xxiii) Copeland Markets LLC; (xxiv) Yensai.com Co., Ltd; and (xxv) Octaura Holdings LLC.</p>
<p>Clients understand and acknowledge that the Custodian may effect trades on behalf of client accounts through ECNs, ATSs and similar execution systems and trading venues (collectively, “Trading Systems”), including Trading Systems in which the Custodian and/or its affiliates may have a direct or indirect ownership interest. In addition, Clients understand and agree that, subject at all times to its obligations to obtain best execution for its customers’ orders, the Custodian will route certain customer order flow to its affiliates, and that, the Custodian and/or its affiliates own an interest in certain ECNs or ATSs as listed above. The ECNs and ATSs on which the Custodian trades for client accounts and in which the Custodian and/or its affiliates own interests may change from time to time. Clients may contact the Custodian for an up-to-date list of ECNs and ATSs in which the Custodian and/or its affiliates own interests. Clients hereby authorize the Custodian to effect trades on behalf of your account(s) through all such Trading Systems, affiliated and unaffiliated, and all such other Trading Systems through which the Custodian may determine to trade in the future. Clients further acknowledge that the Application shall constitute the requisite authorization and notice of the Custodian’s intent to trade through all such Trading Systems, pursuant to ERISA Section 408(b)(16) and/or Code Section 4975(d)(19).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Custodian regularly and rigorously monitors the quality of the executions provided by all market centers to which customer orders are routed to ensure those market centers are providing the best execution reasonably available under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding these disclosures will be provided upon written request and certain order routing information is available online at <a alt="Visit the Wealth Disclosure Page" href="http://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-disclosures/disclosures" target="_blank">www.morganstanley.com/wealth-disclosures/disclosures</a>.</p>
<p>On request of a customer, the Custodian will disclose to such customer the identity of the venue to which such customer’s orders were routed for execution in the six months prior to the request, whether the orders were directed orders or non-directed orders, and the time of the transactions, if any, that resulted from such orders as well as other customer specific order routing and execution information that is required by SEC Rule 606(b)(3).<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p><b>Allocation of Roles and Responsibilities Under Your Retirement Plan</b></p>
<p>Many different parties have important roles to play in the administration of a retirement plan (including plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and/or subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) or other statutes). In order to administer the Plan in a prudent and effective manner in compliance with applicable laws, it is important to understand the roles that outside providers may play and the role that we play as broker and service provider.</p>
<p>Further, completion of an Adoption Agreement for a Prototype Qualified Retirement Plan – Defined Contribution Basic Plan Document (“Prototype Plan Document”) requires consideration of complex tax and legal issues. Employers should consult with or should obtain the advice of legal counsel and/or a tax advisor before executing an Adoption Agreement. Once executed, the Adoption Agreement is a legal document with significant tax and legal ramifications and the failure to properly complete the Adoption Agreement or administer the Plan may result in disqualification of the Plan. Neither the Custodian nor any of its agents or affiliates assume any responsibility for the completion of, and operation of the Plan established under, the prototype plan documentation that the Custodian makes available.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the duties that various parties may undertake with respect to the Plan; whether such parties actually perform the described duties will depend upon decisions made by the Employer/Plan Sponsor.</p>

<li>Provides distribution forms to participants/beneficiaries;</li>
<li>Approves hardship withdrawals and other Plan distributions where available under the Plan;</li>
<li>Approves Plan loans to participants where available under the Plan and monitors the repayment of these loans;</li>

<li>Reviews and approves all requests for distributions under Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (“QDROs”);</li>
<li>Reviews, determines legitimacy of, and approves claims for benefits;</li>
<li>Establishes various policies related to the operation of the Plan, and maintains Plan records;</li>
<li>Files Form 5500 reports and other required information with government agencies, such as the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Custodian and its affiliates will not file Form 5500 on behalf of any plan; and</li>
<li>Provides tax reporting with respect to distributions from the Plan (tax reporting and other duties listed above may also be performed by the Plan Trustee or another designated party), except in situations where the Custodian may take on such responsibilities (as described under Role of Morgan Stanley).</li>

<p>Certain types of retirement plans, such as Internal Revenue Code section 401(k) plans and other defined contribution plans, often utilize the specialized services of TPAs or consultants who may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process enrollments, contributions, distributions and loans to participant account records as authorized by the Plan Administrator;</li>
<li>Perform various tests for compliance under Internal Revenue Code qualification provisions (including maximum deferral percentage, nondiscrimination, coverage, top-heavy, minimum participation);</li>

            <span><p><b>Role of the Custodian</b></p>
<p>In assisting the Employer/Plan Sponsor and the other designated parties who have responsibilities under the Plan, the Custodian can provide specific services that are separate from the duties of the Named Fiduciary, Plan Administrator, Trustee and TPA. If requested by the Employer/Plan Sponsor or other appropriate party, the Custodian can provide one or more of the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as broker-dealer to the Plan in providing a wide range of potential investment options for the Plan;</li>
<li>Offer a “prototype” plan documents for Employer/Plan Sponsors to use that comply with the various qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, and ensure that amendments required to maintain the Plan document are provided to the Plan Sponsor when necessary;</li>
<li>Offer brokerage accounts to the Plan and its participants that enable Trustees, participants and other authorized individuals to direct the investment of Plan account balances;</li>
<li>Offer advisory programs;</li>
<li>Employee education services;</li>
<li>Assist in enrollment of participants; and/or</li>
<li>Assist Plan fiduciaries in evaluating Plan investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Custodian and its affiliates will not serve as Trustee, Plan Administrator, Named Fiduciary or TPA for the Plan, though the Custodian does provide tax reporting and withholding services for certain Plans.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, the Custodian is not responsible for ensuring that contributions are made to the Plan, or providing various reports and disclosures to governmental agencies or participants (e.g., Form 5500, Summary Plan Description). Furthermore, the Custodian will not be responsible for ensuring that fiduciaries and other persons handling funds or property of a plan are appropriately bonded as required under ERISA.</p>
