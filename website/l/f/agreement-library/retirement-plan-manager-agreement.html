Morgan Stanley is willing to provide such products and services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement (the “Agreement”).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Employer, the Trustee, (if applicable), the Participant (if applicable) and Morgan Stanley agree as follows:<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

            <span><h3><span class="span-block vertical-offset-base">Article I — General</span></h3>
<p>1.1 The Clients represent and warrant that the Employer has duly adopted a retirement plan document (“Plan Document”) and that the Plan is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) with a related trust that is exempt from tax under Code section 501(a) (“Qualified Trust”) (or a custodial arrangement under Code section 401(f) that is treated as a Qualified Trust). The Clients acknowledge that Morgan Stanley did not provide, or otherwise make available, to the Employer a prototype retirement plan document.</p>
<p>1.2 The Trustee or Employer, as applicable, has independently determined that the terms of the Application and this Agreement comply with the terms of the Plan Document for the Plan.</p>
<p>1.3 The Account will be linked to a non-transactional plan account. The plan account will be used for Morgan Stanley’s administrative purposes only, such as maintaining plan information or linking related accounts maintained in connection with the Plan, and cannot be used for contributions, distributions, or to transact trades.</p>
<p>1.4 Morgan Stanley and its affiliates will not serve as a Trustee, Plan Administrator, Named Fiduciary or Third-Party Administrator for the Plan. Neither Morgan Stanley nor its affiliates shall have any duty, obligation or responsibility for the administration of the Plan or its qualification under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>1.5 The Clients represent and warrant that they have received and reviewed a copy of Schedule A, Allocation of Roles and Responsibilities Under Your Retirement Plan, which generally outlines the role Morgan Stanley does and does not perform with respect to the Plan and the Account, and agree that it accurately describes the Clients’ understanding of Morgan Stanley’s general responsibilities.</p>
<p>1.6 Clients will notify Morgan Stanley in writing of any amendment to any Plan Documents, any change in the composition of the Trustees, or any other event which could materially alter the statements in the Application or this Agreement, and Morgan Stanley may rely on the continued validity of this information indefinitely, absent actual receipt of such written notice.</p>
<p>1.7 If there is more than one Trustee of the Plan or authorized representative of the Employer, as applicable, any action in connection with the Account requires the authorization of only one Trustee or one authorized representative, as applicable.</p>
<p>1.8 The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, hereby covenant that if they sign and deliver to Morgan Stanley any document which effectuates a delegation of investment management, such parties are authorized under the Plan Document and/or applicable law to delegate investment management, and that Morgan Stanley shall have no independent duty to verify their authority to delegate investment management.</p>
<p>1.9 Each person authorized in this Agreement to act on behalf of the Plan represents and warrants that all instructions given with respect to the Account are within the authorities given by, or pursuant to, the Plan Document and agrees to jointly and severally indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, employees and agents from any and all liabilities that may be incurred by virtue of acting on said instructions. Such parties shall be under no obligation to inquire into the purpose of any instruction given including but not limited to the delivery of securities or other property or the payment of money either to an authorized representative of the Plan or any third party and shall not be bound to see to the application or disposition of said securities, other property or money. In the event of the death or removal of an authorized representative, the remaining authorized representatives shall immediately give Morgan Stanley written notice thereof and Morgan Stanley may, before or after receiving such notice, take such proceedings, require such documents, retain such portion of the Account and/or restrict transactions in the Account as Morgan Stanley may deem advisable to protect against any real or perceived liabilities. The Plan shall remain liable to Morgan Stanley for any debt or loss in the Account resulting from transactions initiated prior to Morgan Stanley’s receipt of written notice of such death or removal including but not limited to losses or debts resulting from such transactions.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p>3.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Morgan Stanley, the Employer, Trustee or Participant, as applicable, shall direct the investments in the Account.</p>

If the Account is designated as a Trustee-Directed Pooled Account, the Trustee or Employer, as applicable, will have the authority to trade in the Account. The Trustee or Employer, as applicable, is responsible for ensuring that all account transaction and investment instructions provided are in accordance with the Plan Documents.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">i. securities and other investments that are available for acquisition through Morgan Stanley in its regular course of business and permitted by Morgan Stanley for investment under the Account according to its policies and procedures then in effect; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">ii. other investments Morgan Stanley in its sole discretion agrees to hold according to its policies and procedures then in effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c) Morgan Stanley’s decision to permit the holding of any investment in the Account shall not constitute approval of the investment merits of the investment nor a judgment as to the prudence, advisability or appropriateness of the investment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">d) Morgan Stanley reserves the absolute right to revoke its decision to permit the holding in the Account of any investment at any time and for any reason and may resign as custodian with respect to such investment in accordance with Article VII or distribute in-kind the investment, and Morgan Stanley shall have no liability for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by the Clients by reason of the revocation of Morgan Stanley’s decision.</p>
<p>3.2 All assets of the Account shall be registered in the name of Morgan Stanley or of a nominee (the same nominee may be used with respect to assets of other investors whether or not held under agreements similar to this one or in any fiduciary capacity whatsoever), provided, however, that Morgan Stanley may hold any security in bearer form or by or through a central clearing corporation maintained by institutions active in the national securities markets.</p>
<p>3.3 As further described in the Summary of the Bank Deposit Program and the Bank Deposit Disclosure Statement applicable to the Account, the Clients authorize and direct the deposit or investment of cash balances in the Account (including, but not limited to, uninvested cash, dividends and distributions on shares of mutual funds or other investments held in the Account that are paid in cash) in</p>

<p>9.2 Payment of Fees and Expenses.<b> </b>The Employer or Trustee, as applicable, is responsible for paying any account, custodial, or related administrative charges Morgan Stanley might reasonably require and disclose in connection with the process of opening or maintaining the Account. Any brokerage fees, commissions and related expenses shall be paid in the customary manner. In the event an Account is terminated or transferred, a termination or transfer fee may be due and payable on the date of the termination or transfer. Reimbursement for expenses shall be due and payable upon demand. Morgan Stanley reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to elect to discount or waive certain fees for certain customers.

If it is subsequently determined that such payments are improperly paid from Plan assets, Employer or Trustee, as applicable, agrees to indemnify Morgan Stanley for any and all amounts expended to correct such payments.</p>
<p>9.3 Deduction of Fees and Expenses.<b> </b>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Account shall be subject to the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of Morgan Stanley, as described in the Agreement and any other fee schedules and documentation, as may be amended from time to time.

To effect the payment of fees and expenses from the Account, Morgan Stanley may liquidate assets held in the IRA in accordance with Section 5.3(f).</p>
<p>9.4 Float. Clients understand and agree that Morgan Stanley may retain, as compensation for the performance of services, the Account’s proportionate share of any interest earned on aggregate cash balances held by Morgan Stanley with respect to “assets awaiting investment or other processing.” This amount, known as “float,” is earned by us through investment in overnight cash deposits and highly liquid securities (e.g., U.S. government obligations), with the amount of such earnings retained by us, due to the short-term nature of the investments, being generally at the prevailing overnight interest rate applicable to these investments. This rate averaged approximately one hundred sixty nine points during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, but please note that due to market fluctuations the rate will change – please contact us for more current information. “Assets awaiting investment or other processing” for these purposes includes, to the degree applicable: (i) new deposits to the Account, including interest and dividends; (ii) any uninvested assets held by the Account caused by an instruction to purchase or sell securities (which may, after the period described below, be automatically swept into a sweep vehicle); (iii) assets held in the Plan Account (where applicable); and (iv) withdrawals from the Account, to the degree checkwriting privileges may be offered to the Plan. With respect to assets awaiting investment or other processing: (i) where such assets are received by Morgan Stanley on a day on which the New York Stock Exchange and/or the Federal Reserve Banks are open (“Business Day”), float shall generally be earned by us through the end of that Business Day (known as the “Sweep Date”), with the Account credited interest/dividends in such funds as of the next Business Day following the Sweep Date; or (ii) where such assets are received on a Business Day that is not followed by another Business Day, or on a day which is not a Business Day, float shall generally be earned by us through the end of the next Business Day. Delays in providing investment instruction could result in increased compensation in the form of float. Please note, however, that uninvested cash typically does not await sweep for more than one day and Morgan Stanley does not invest, and therefore does not earn interest on, all uninvested client cash. Where Morgan Stanley facilitates a distribution from the Account, Morgan Stanley earns float on money set aside for payment of outstanding but uncashed checks, generally from the date on the face of the checks until the date that either the recipient cashes the check, or the check is cancelled and the underlying funds are returned to the Account.</p>
<p>For example: If $10,000 is deposited into an Account and those funds are awaiting investment (i.e., the funds are not swept into the Bank Deposit Program, a money market fund or otherwise invested), Morgan Stanley may earn interest or “float” on the funds (as further described above). Assuming the interest rate is 1.69%, Morgan Stanley would earn approximately 47 cents per day ($10,000*1.69% / 360 = $0.47).</p>
<p>9.5 Payment for Order Flow and other Routing Arrangements and Use of Electronic Communication Networks and Alternative Trading Systems.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is committed to providing the best execution for customers’ orders. In furtherance of this commitment, Morgan Stanley considers several factors, including price, the available liquidity pool, execution speed, transaction costs, service and opportunities for price improvement in determining where to route customer orders for execution.</p>
<p>Industry regulations require that we disclose whether we receive compensation for directing client orders for execution to various dealers, national securities exchanges, alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including electronic communications networks (“ECNs”), and other market centers. This compensation is commonly referred to as “payment for order flow.”</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, either directly or indirectly, may route customer equity orders to national securities exchanges, ATSs, including ECNs, and other market centers, including its affiliate Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley & Co.”). Certain market centers offer cash credits for orders that provide liquidity to their books and charge explicit fees for orders that extract liquidity from their books (and certain market centers invert this practice). From time to time, the amount of credits that Morgan Stanley receives from one or more such market centers may exceed the amount Morgan Stanley is charged. Morgan Stanley receives the benefit of these credits, either directly or indirectly, and such payments constitute payment for order flow. Morgan Stanley may also receive incremental pricing benefits from exchanges and/or ECNs if certain volume thresholds are met.</p>
<p>In addition, Morgan Stanley & Co. may route certain customer orders (including orders for fixed income securities, preferred shares and convertible bonds) to Morgan Stanley & Co. on behalf of Morgan Stanley. These arrangements between Morgan Stanley & Co. and Morgan Stanley are intended to facilitate trade execution for our customers, with apportionment of resulting expenses and revenue from the trading activity between Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley & Co. Morgan Stanley & Co. participates in Exchange-sponsored listed option payment for order flow programs and accepts payment for order flow for certain listed option orders. In the course of providing liquidity, Morgan Stanley & Co. may preference certain option orders to Morgan Stanley & Co.’s options market maker, or third-party market makers for execution. Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates have ownership interests in and/or Board seats on ECNs or other ATSs. In certain instances, Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may be deemed to control one or more of such ECNs or ATSs based on the level of such ownership interests and whether Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates are represented on the Board of such ECNs or ATSs. Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may from time to time, directly or indirectly, effect client trades through ECNs or other ATSs in which Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates have or may acquire an interest or Board seat, and Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may thereby receive an indirect economic benefit based upon their ownership in the ECNs or other ATSs. Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates will, directly or indirectly, execute through an ECN or other ATS in which it has an interest only in situations where Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates, or the broker-dealer through whom they are accessing the ECN or ATS, reasonably believes such transaction will be in the best interest of its clients and the requirements of applicable law have been satisfied.</p>
<p>As noted above, Morgan Stanley, subject at all times to its obligations to obtain best execution for its customers’ orders, will route certain customer order flow to Morgan Stanley & Co. Furthermore, as of December 2022, Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates own an interest in certain ECNs or ATSs, including: (i) National Stock Exchange of India; (ii) Miami International Holdings Inc.; (iii) Equilend; (iv) Euroclear Holding SA/NV; (v) LCH Group Holdings Limited (Clearing); (vi) CME; (vii) ICE US Holding Company, LP; (viii) OTCDeriv Limited; (ix) TIFFE – Tokyo Financial Futures Exchange; (x) iSWAP Limited; (xi) EOS Precious Metals Limited; (xii) Creditderiv Limited; (xiii) FXGlobalClear; (xiv) Japan Securities Clearing Corporation; (xv) CME/CBOT/NYMEX; (xvi) Dubai Mercantile Exchange; (xvii) Intercontinental Exchange; (xviii) Bombay Stock Exchange; (xix) Japan Securities Depository Center Inc.; (xx) MEMX Holdings LLC; (xxi) LCH.Clearnet Group LTD; (xxii) The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation; (xxiii) Copeland Markets LLC; (xxiv) Yensai.com Co., Ltd; and (xxv) Octaura Holdings LLC.</p>
<p>Clients understand and acknowledge that Morgan Stanley may effect trades on behalf of client accounts through ECNs, ATSs and similar execution systems and trading venues (collectively, “Trading Systems”), including Trading Systems in which Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may have a direct or indirect ownership interest. In addition, Clients understand and agree that, subject at all times to its obligations to obtain best execution for its customers’ orders, Morgan Stanley will route certain customer order flow to its affiliates, and that, Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates own an interest in certain ECNs or ATSs as listed above. The ECNs and ATSs on which Morgan Stanley trades for client accounts and in which Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates own interests may change from time to time. Clients may contact Morgan Stanley for an up-to-date list of ECNs and ATSs in which Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates own interests. Clients hereby authorize Morgan Stanley to effect trades on behalf of your account(s) through all such Trading Systems, affiliated and unaffiliated, and all such other Trading Systems through which Morgan Stanley may determine to trade in the future. Clients further acknowledge that the Application shall constitute the requisite authorization and notice of Morgan Stanley’s intent to trade through all such Trading Systems, pursuant to ERISA Section 408(b)(16) and/or Code Section 4975(d)(19).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Morgan Stanley regularly and rigorously monitors the quality of the executions provided by all market centers to which customer orders are routed to ensure those market centers are providing the best execution reasonably available under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding these disclosures will be provided upon written request and certain order routing information is available online at <a alt="Read wealth disclosures" href="http://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-disclosures/disclosures" target="_blank">www.morganstanley.com/wealth-disclosures/disclosures</a>.</p>
<p>On request of a customer, Morgan Stanley will disclose to such customer the identity of the venue to which such customer’s orders were routed for execution in the six months prior to the request, whether the orders were directed orders or non-directed orders, and the time of the transactions, if any, that resulted from such orders as well as other customer specific order routing and execution information that is required by SEC Rule 606(b)(3).<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p>10.1<b> </b>In the event Morgan Stanley is merged with an unaffiliated legal entity where Morgan Stanley is not the surviving entity, or if Morgan Stanley is acquired (in whole or in part) by another unaffiliated legal entity who acquires the custodial retirement business of Morgan Stanley, such entity shall become custodian, under this document, so long as (a) the terms of such operative documents providing for the assumption of the role of custodian by the acquisition or merger specify the assumption of Morgan Stanley and (b) such successor or acquiring entity satisfies the requirements under the Code and applicable Federal and state law for serving as a custodian.

<p><b>Allocation of Roles and Responsibilities Under Your Retirement Plan</b></p>
<p>Many different parties have important roles to play in the administration of a retirement plan (including plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and/or subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) or other statutes). In order to administer the Plan in a prudent and effective manner in compliance with applicable laws, it is important to understand the roles that outside providers may play and the role that Morgan Stanley plays as broker and service provider.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the duties that various parties may undertake with respect to the Plan; whether such parties actually perform the described duties will depend upon decisions made by the Plan Sponsor. We encourage you to share the information below with your tax and/or legal advisors.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>
