<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Total Wealth View is a digital tool available to you from Morgan Stanley via a service provider, Yodlee, Inc. (“Service Provider”).</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Wealth View (“Asset Aggregation”) is an asset aggregation tool </b>that utilizes vendor-supported technology to retrieve information, as authorized by you, about your accounts, assets, and liabilities under your ownership or control that you hold at or are custodied by other entities, outside of Morgan Stanley, alongside, if applicable, your accounts at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset Aggregation is a “Service” as referenced herein.</p>
<p><b>By accepting these terms of use, you confirm you have received, reviewed, and understood the terms of this agreement, and that you sign and agree to such terms.</b></p>
<p>After accepting, you can find this document by logging into either Morgan Stanley Online or ETRADE.com.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

        <div>
            <span><h4>1. Parties; Scope; Eligibility</h4>
<p><b>A. </b>Your use of the applicable Service is governed by these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). The words “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Morgan Stanley” refer to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB”) and, if applicable, our affiliate(s), and any agent, independent contractor, designee, officer, and employee that we, in our sole discretion, involve in the provision of the Service.  The words "you," "your," and "yours" mean you, as an authorized user of a Service.</p>
<p><b>B. </b>The Service is made available to you on an unsolicited basis. Unless otherwise provided for herein, to qualify for use of a Service, you must be (i) a Customer, (ii) an Authorized User, (iii) an eligible Participant (as such terms in subparts (i)-(iii) are defined in the Morgan Stanley Online Services Agreement),  (iv) a prospective customer (“Prospect”) who has been granted access to the Service via Morgan Stanley Online pursuant to the Morgan Stanley Online Prospective Client Access Terms and Conditions, or (v) a customer or authorized user of an E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley account (“E*TRADE User”).</p>
<p><b>C. </b>We reserve the right to determine in our sole discretion your eligibility for a Service. This includes a Service or functionalities of a Service being restricted or unavailable to you.  We may also require you to take additional actions after accepting these Terms, such as an activation step, before you have access to a Service. Further, we may require you to re-accept these Terms if your relationship with Morgan Stanley changes, such as if you open a brokerage or managed account with us or if you enroll into a Service that was previously unavailable to you.</p>
<p><b>D. </b>You understand that some or all of a Service may not be available in all jurisdictions, and the Service is not intended to be provided to and may not be used by any party in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules, or regulations (“Applicable Law”).<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

            <span><h4>2. Information about the Service</h4>
<p><b>A. Total Wealth View</b></p>
<p>(i) For purposes of these Terms, unless noted otherwise, accounts, assets, or liabilities custodied at or held with any entity other than a Morgan Stanley affiliate (including MSSB, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any Morgan Stanley banking entity) are referenced herein as “External Accounts.”</p>
<p>(ii) With Asset Aggregation, you can aggregate information in two ways: (1) You or an authorized party can manually input information about the applicable account, assets, and/or liabilities (each a "Manually Added Account") or (2) you can authorize us and our Service Provider to access third-party websites ("Third-Party Sites") designated by you and obtain, on your behalf, information about the applicable External Accounts stored on or available via such Third-Party Site. A Manually Added Account does not have to be an External Account.</p>
<p>(iii) You may use the Asset Aggregation functionality without using any other service offered by us via the Service Provider, if applicable.</p>
<p><b>B. Authorizations Granted to MSSB and Service Provider</b></p>
<p><b>(i) By using the Services, you are authorizing us and our Service Provider to access your External Accounts and Third-Party Sites on your behalf and as requested by you for purposes of providing the Services.  </b></p>
<p><b>(ii)</b> <b>You understand and agree that you may be subject to user terms presented by the Service Provider to you that may, among other things, require you to grant them authorization in order for them to fulfill the Service for you. </b></p>
<p><b>(iii) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN WE OR THE SERVICE PROVIDER ACCESSES AND RETRIEVES INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SITES, WE AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT THE AGENT OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY. You agree that we shall be entitled to rely on the authorization granted by you. You understand and agree that the Services are not endorsed or sponsored by any Third-Party Site providers accessible through the Service. You agree that we do not assume any responsibility and that we shall incur no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, or determinations of any provider of such Third-Party Site.</b><span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p><b>A. </b>You acknowledge and represent to us that you are an owner of, a legal signer for, and/or are legally authorized to access each External Account and Third-Party Site, have the authority to designate us as your agent, use the Services, and to give us the applicable credentials/registration or other information in order for us or our Service Provider to provide the applicable Service. You understand that such activity may include the Service Provider submitting on your behalf any credential/registration or other information (e.g. user names and passwords) provided by you to the Third-Party Site.  You further understand that without accurate information, we will not be able to provide the Services to you. 
You therefore agree to keep up to date your credentials/registration or other information we or our Service Provider need to provide the applicable Service.</p>
<p><b>B.</b> You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any terms of service provided through or by third-party financial institutions, custodians, or Third-Party Sites, and if you have any problems with your External Accounts or Third-Party Sites you should contact the providers of such External Accounts and Third-Party Sites directly.</p>
<p><b>C. </b>You understand you may not use the Services to initiate transactions affecting your External Accounts or provide notices or instructions affecting such External Accounts.  Any transactions or other activities at such Third-Party Site are not made through the Services or the Service Provider and we assume no responsibility for such activities.</p>
<p><b>D. </b>You are responsible for all charges associated with any Third-Party Site, and you understand and agree that we and our Service Provider assume no responsibility for any such charges or terms.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p><b>A. </b>We respect your privacy and work to maintain the privacy and security of any personal information collected through your use of the Services.  Details of how Morgan Stanley collects, stores, uses, and protects your personal information can be found in Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Privacy Policy and Notice (“Privacy Policy”), which is accessible via <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/privacy-pledge">https://www.morganstanley.com/privacy-pledge</a>.</p>
<p><b>B. </b>You understand that, pursuant to the Notice to End Users above, we assume no responsibility for any statements about data collection, storage, use, or protection in a Service Provider supplied terms of use, and any obligations or disputes arising between you and the Service Provider about such statements shall be governed by such separate terms.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

            <span><h4>5. Information Visibility</h4>
<p><b>A. </b>Through your use of the Services, if you have a financial advisor, your Account information, including information about your External Accounts, if applicable, will be accessed by your financial advisor (and your financial advisor’s associates and supervisors) (collectively, “Financial Advisor”). Such information may include transaction-level account activity such as transaction or merchant name, date, amount, and, if applicable, categorization labels ("Transaction-Level Activity").</p>
<p><b>B. </b>Under the Asset Aggregation Service, for External Accounts that you have aggregated, certain Transaction-Level Activity will remain private. This means that your Financial Advisor will not see a description of your Transaction-Level Activity but will see the transaction date and transaction amount (e.g., your Financial Advisor will see that you used your debit card to make a $3.00 purchase on a certain date, but not that it was at a coffee shop).<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

            <span><h4>6. Un-Enrollment from a Service or of Your Relationship with MSSB; Disposition and Retention</h4>
<p><b>You may stop using a Service at any time. However, ceasing to use a Service will not result in automatic deletion of any information retrieved or produced as part of a Service; please review the information on un-enrollment below for additional information.</b></p>
<p><b>A. Un-Enrollment from Asset Aggregation</b></p>
<p><b>To un-enroll from Asset Aggregation, you must cease using the Service and delete your External Accounts and any Manually Added Accounts.</b></p>
<p>(i) Upon deletion, the information about your External Accounts, including any and all records of any or all information created, acquired, collected, or otherwise about you or available to you through the Services (collectively, "External Account Information") will no longer be available to you, your Financial Advisor (if applicable), or MSSB. At such time, certain of your External Account Information will be deleted from the Service Provider’s systems automatically while any remaining External Account Information will be deleted from the Service Provider’s systems within 90 days.</p>
<p>(ii) If applicable, you understand that certain other tools offered by us via the Service Provider may include External Accounts and Manually Added Accounts from Asset Aggregation and your deletion of such information may affect your use of such other tools.</p>
<p><b>B. Retention by MSSB</b></p>
<p>External Account Information obtained by us through your use of the Services may be retained by us for periods of time and in a form as determined by us or required or permitted by Applicable Law, business practice, or our policy or procedure. In some cases, we may be required to retain such information indefinitely including information permitted or required to be retained under applicable law, rule or regulation or the administration of our business.</p>
<p><b>C. Termination of Your Relationship with MSSB</b></p>
<p>In the event that you terminate your relationship with MSSB and/or if MSSB terminates its relationship with you, we have the right to terminate your access to the Services and any information retrieved and stored as a part of a Service.</p>
<p>The Service Provider may, independently of MSSB, provide the ability for you to find out what kind of data they hold after termination directly via their website.  You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any such requests, information provided, or any other aspect of your direct interaction with the Service Provider.<span class="span-block vertical-offset-base"></span></p>

<p><b>A. Accurate Information</b></p>
<p>In addition to other limitations on liability set forth in these Terms, MSSB and its Service Provider shall incur no liability to you if the Services do not function as described because you have not provided us with the correct registration or credential information, or other information used to provide the Services to you.</p>
<p><b>B. No Responsibility for Third-Party Sites</b></p>
<p>(i) All of your External Account information available through the Services is provided by third parties. We make no effort to review, and we are not responsible for, nor do we endorse or recommend, any products, services, or content of any Third-Party Site, including, but not limited to, the validity, legality, or copyright compliance of the content contained in these Third-Party Sites. You acknowledge that we do not pre-screen content, but that we and our representatives, agents, and designees will have the right (but not the obligation) in our or their sole discretion to refuse, edit, move, or remove any content that is available via the Services.</p>
<p>(ii) Any third-party information about securities and other investments available through the Services reflect independent opinions and are not recommendations. The information and content provided via the Services are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation to buy, or a recommendation of any security or other investment . You understand and agree that you must perform your own evaluation of any investment based on your investment objectives, financial resources, and risk tolerance.</p>
<p><b>C. Limitations of Manually Added Account and External Account Information</b><br />
</p>
<p>(i) Information related to your Manually Added Accounts reflects only the information that you provide. You acknowledge that Manually Added Account and External Account Information is not updated by us and that we do not guarantee its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.</p>
<p>(ii) For any information related to your External Accounts obtained by the Service Provider, this information reflects the most recent refresh by the Service Provider and may not be accurate or timely if a refresh was not successfully completed or the information obtained from the Third-Party Site is otherwise not accurate or current. For example, when displayed, External Account Information is only as current a representation of the information from the Third-Party Site at the time displayed, which reflects when the Service Provider obtained the information from the source. You acknowledge that such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly by you from the relevant Third-Party Site. Neither we nor our Service Providers shall be liable for any errors or delays in the content provided through the Services, or for any actions taken in reliance thereon.</p>
<p>(iii) Your Manually Added Account and External Account information is provided for informational purposes only. The transactions viewed in your External Account are not custodied with us and cannot be used for trading or transactional purposes. However, we have the right to inquire with you about any Manually Added Account or External Account information as it may relate to your account or information with us, and in the event of a court order or request from a competent legal or regulatory authority, we may be required to provide such information.</p>
<p>(iv) Unless otherwise agreed under a separate agreement with us, you understand and agree that we will not (a) provide any investment advice, recommendations, or other services regarding your Manually Added Accounts or External Accounts or on any assets, transactions, or implementation of any investment strategy in such Manually Added Accounts or External Accounts, (b) be responsible for any transactions you execute in your Manually Added Accounts or External Accounts, and (c) include the assets in a Manually Added Account or External Account in the calculation of any fees, commissions, or other charges you may owe us.</p>
<p><b>D. Limitation of Liability</b></p>
<p>THE FOREGOING SHALL CONSTITUTE OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT WE (INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY HARM, OFTEN KNOWN AS DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES AND/OR THE INSTALLATION, USE, OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY SERVICES RELATED EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE AND/OR THE SERVICES; (II) THE COST OF GETTING SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANYONE ON THE SERVICES; (V) THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY SITE, EVEN IF THE PROVIDER OF SUCH THIRD-PARTY SITE HAS BEEN ADVISED PREVIOUSLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; (VI) ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES, (VII) THE SITE OR USE THEREOF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE BY ANY PARTY, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, EVEN IF WE, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, OR REPRESENTATIVES THEREOF, ARE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES, OR (VIII) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES.</p>
